You're in a group project with some friends/friendly classmates. What role do you take? <br>
<input type="radio" name="Q1" id="ma1"> I'm doing this shit solo. No offense, but my group doesn't know how to do this and I'm not bothering to teach them. People would just get in my way. <br> 
<input type="radio" name="Q1" id="a1">Team leader all the way. I'll rule with an iron fist!!! I know what to do best, and I should be in charge. (Could be polite or dickish while ruling, but still rule with an irond dick)<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q1" id="ka1">I'll probably branch off and start working on my own. I'll still collaborate with the team and give help if they ask, but they'll deal with their shit and I'll deal with mine. <br>
<input type="radio" name="Q1" id="kp1">I'll give the team some guidance in the form of a leader and I'll do as I'm told, but I'll probably start doing my own thing instead of spending all my time leading. I'll still keep my teammates somewhat updated on what I'm doing, though. <br>
<input type="radio" name="Q1" id="p1">I'll chip in where I'm needed and help as best I can. <br>
<input type="radio" name="Q1"id="mp1">I'll do as best I can to help the team, but would stick near the leader for directions. I appreciate it if someone is telling me what to do. <br>
<br>
While doing some late-game grinding, you stop to rest inside a cave. Despite a normal exterior, you discover an interior more akin to a Victorian-era home. Seated at a desk in front of you is a white horse with no facial features and a green bow tie. The horse emits a series of telepathic neighs and whinnies, which you immediately understand to be a proposition: The horse will grant you incredible powers, among them super-strength, super-speed, regeneration, and glowy skin, on the condition that if you accept your teammates' sprites will all instantly die. As you comprehend the gravity of the situation, it laughs a very evil, horsey laugh. At least, you think it was evil. What would an evil horse laugh even sound like? And more importantly, do you make a deal with the (equine) devil?<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q2" id="ma2"> Ab-so-lutely!!! they'll never know it was you!<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q2"  id="mad">Yes. No hesitation. You can justify to yourself and say "oh,, my powers will help the team, so it cancels out them losing their sprites", but if you're being honest, you just want those cool powers.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q2"id="a2">No hesitation. First, these powers are sick, and second, you know it will help the team. <br>
<input type="radio" name="Q2" id = "ka2">After thinking about it, yes. First, you get cool powers, and secondly, you can help the team. You're not stoked about the losing of the sprites, but you think you can help out in their place.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q2"id="kp2">After thinking about it, no. Even those powers would be totally super cool and awesome, you realize how much your team relies on those sprites, and you begrudgingly say no. But you kinda wish you didn't, cause damn those powers were awesome.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q2" id="p2">No. Even though the powers are cool, those are you team's sprites you're talking about! No hesitation.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q2" id="mp2"> You ask him if you can come back later after you've conferred with your team. This is kinda their decision after all. <br>
<br>
You're in a relationship you've been in for a while, and you have to accept you can't stay here any longer. It's not good anymore.  You want to leave, but you know leaving would destroy your partner. AU where any of your characters get bitches.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q3"id="ma3"> You leave. You need to focus on your future and yourself, and you're not giving up on your life for someone else.<br> 
<input type="radio" name="Q3" id="a3">You leave. You know your partner is going to suffer, and it's not something you're looking forwards to, but you're not sacrificing your happiness for someone else. <br>
<input type="radio" name="Q3" id = "kap">After some deliberation, you decide to leave. You didn't want things to end this way, but in the end it's what's best for both of you.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q3" id="p3">You want to see if you can try to fix things. You love them, and you don't want to hurt them or lose them, even if things aren't working out now. If you really can't fix things, then you know there's no other option for you two but to end it, but god you're going to try first.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q3" id="mp3">You're staying. You can still fix this. Fuck, the odds are stacked up against you two, but you can't just leave.<br>
<br>
What do you do when hardship comes your way?<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q4"id="ma4"> Take it head on and strong. It's only temporary, and you're making your way out on top (even if you have to be a little unethical to get there).<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q4" id="a4">>You might get knocked down, but you'll get back up again once it's over.<br> 
<input type="radio" name="Q4" id="p4">Endure, bear it as it comes, and talk to your friends once it's over. <br>
<input type="radio" name="Q4" id="mp4">Calm down and try to slip away for a bit until it's over. <br>
<br>
You have been in a competition of sorts. Whatever it is you need to do, it’s becoming increasingly obvious towards the end that your partner in this competition is unable to keep up with you and everyone else. What do you do?<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q5"id="ma5"> Leave your partner behind. They're only weighing you down, and you're sure you can come up with a way to win yourself. <br>
<input type="radio" name="Q5" id="a5">Push yourself harder to make up for your partner's shortcomings and attempt to carry the team.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q5" id="p5">Try to do the best you two can. Even if you don't win, you'll cross the finish line together. <br>
<input type="radio" name="Q5" id="mp5">Focus your time and energy on helping them along, to see if there's anything you can do to improve their stats. <br>
<br>
On a scale of 1-6, how comfortable are you on taking orders from other people.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q6"id="ma6"> One. Not at all. I prefer to be work on my own, and if I'm in a team I'd better be the leader.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q6" id="a6">Two. Don't try to order me around! I'd rather lead or have no leader at all. <br>
<input type="radio" name="Q6"id="ka6">Three. Begrudgingly. I'll do it if I have to, but I prefer to work without a bossy leader.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q6" id="kp6">Four. I don't mind it and could go either way, as long as they're not going too far. <br>
<input type="radio" name="Q6" id="p6">Five. I kind of work best in an environment where someone else is giving me direction, as long as I still have some freedom.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q6" id="mp6">Six. I don't like not doing it. I work best when someone is telling what to do. There are very few times when I want to take big actions without the influence of other people. <br>
<br>
How many of the choices you make are unaffected by the opinions of others?<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q7"id="ma7"> All. Only a few times in my life have I relied on the thoughts of others to make my own choices. <br>
<input type="radio" name="Q7" id="a7">Most. I act of my own volition and very rarely rely on the advice of others.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q7"id="ka7">A good portion. If someone else has a good idea I'll go along with that, and I possibly may not rock the boat, but in the end most of my choices come from me and me alone.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q7"id="kp7">It's almost a tie. My big life choices take a little more input from others than me, but I often am doing things based off my own judgement.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q7" id="p7">Some, yeah, but I do try to get my friends to weigh in a lot. <br>
<input type="radio" name="Q7" id="mp7">I prefer to have someone else tell me what to do. Not necessarily in a self deprecating way, but most of the time I'm bouncing off of others' ideas.<br>
<br>
Your best friends have decided to throw a party, and they’re throwing all kinds of ideas to see what sticks. What do you do? AU where your characters are able to form and maintain healthy relationships.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q8"id="ma8"> You take control of the planning and organization, hoping you can satisfy all your friends. <br>
<input type="radio" name="Q8" id="a8">You quickly join the brainstorming of ideas, sifting through them and agreeing with what would make a great party for everyone involved.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q8" id="p8">You suggest things you would like to see in the party, adding to the growing pile of ideas. <br>
<input type="radio" name="Q8" id="mp8">You trust that your friends will make a great party, and only step in to add in something you really really want or to disagree with something you really really don't want.<br>
<br>
You’ve come with a solution to a problem your best friend has been dealing with, which you’re certain would be easy to implement and help them out notably. However, they’re stubbornly ignoring your advice. What do you do?<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q9"id="ma9"> You try to solve the problem yourself. If they keep stubbornly refusing what you think is a perfect solution then someone's gotta do it. <br>
<input type="radio" name="Q9" id="a9">You push the solution harder on them. It's frustrating seeing them dwell on this thing again and again when they could just take your advice. <br>
<input type="radio" name="Q9" id="p9">You try to change their mind some more. You're certain about this and only have their best interests in mind.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q9" id="mp9">You insist, but if they keep refusing your help, you're ready to slink away and evade the topic until they ask for your help or solve the problem themselves. <br>
<br>
A friend has shared information about an issue you’re concerned about on social media, and you realize it’s not too well known of an issue. What do you do? Does not have to be an altruistic issue. It could be there aren't enough babies being put in the soap dispenser if that's something important to your character. <br>
<input type="radio" name="Q10"id="ma10"> You obsess over the issue and put every resource to your disposal to try and better it. No matter the cost, you think you can bring a change. <br>
<input type="radio" name="Q10" id="a10">You share your thoughts and ideas about practical solutions for the issue, and contribute in any way to minimize the issue in any way possible.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q10" id="p10">You try to do whatever you can at the moment. Whatever difference you make is more than enough.<br>
<input type="radio" name="Q10" id="mp10">You sadly cannot do anything to help at the moment, but hopefully talking about it and bringing awareness to the topic will help.
